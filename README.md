size() - Returns the current size of the Linked List.

iterator():Iterator<E> - The implemented iterator.

add(E e) - Adds the given element to the Linked List.

add(int index, E val) - Adds the given element at a specific index within the Linked List.

remove(int index):E - Removes the element at the specified index within the Linked List, and returns that element.

get(int index):E - Returns the element at the specified index within the Linked List.

indexOf(E e):int - Returns the index of a specified element. If the element is not found, this will return -1.
